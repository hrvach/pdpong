# Pong in PDP-1 assembly

This is my attempt to write a program for the PDP-1, as a follow-up to making a [FPGA based emulator](https://github.com/hrvach/fpg1).

Nice people from the Computer History Museum tried it on the original PDP-1 machine and it ended up working, to much of my surprise.

This is officially the oldest platform I ever wrote anything for! :)
